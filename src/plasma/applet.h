 *
 * \brief The base Applet class.
 *
 * Applet provides several important roles for add-ons widgets in Plasma.
 *
 * First, it is the base class for the plugin system and therefore is the
 * interface to applets for host applications.
 * Background painting (allowing for consistent and complex
 * look and feel in just one line of code for applets), loading and starting
 * of scripting support for each applet, providing access to the associated
 * plasmoid package (if any) and access to configuration data.
 *
 * See techbase.kde.org for tutorials on writing Applets using this class.
